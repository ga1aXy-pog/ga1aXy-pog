Hello, my name is ga1aXy-pog on github, but I go as galaxy (my online alias). A few things to know about me is that I spend most of my time learning and discovering new things in a broad spectrum, 
I love music and podcasts, I enjoy watching TV shows like MacGyver, Magnum P.I.(+), Manifest, The Good Doctor, Friends, Seinfield and The Big Bang Theory. I also enjoy playing sport in my free time and creating a few stuff.

My learning spectrum holds subjects like physics, astrophysics, quantum physics (yeah I love physics), mathematics, biology and technology. My code is primarly focused on things that I need help visualizing on the things that I am learning about.
My code visualizing is focused on theories that I work on in physics (mainly to do with the "astro" side, as I am hoping to pursue a career in astrophysics). While most of my theory work will be closed to the public, you might see some of the projects that I have finished and have given good results back to me.

Some of my hobbies are playing basketball and soccer/football with my friends when I don't want to learn something or I am not busy at the moment. 
While I am used to expressing my view in politics, I have entered a state where my passing from left-auth changed to right-lib. 


A few of the projects I've worked on before are the funnctional GalaxBot, which is using discord.js library to function and work. GalaxBot is also an AI that performs checkups on the system of which it is running on and gives back valuable information that can be used to help one with improving things in the computer/laptop. 

Another project that I am constantly using to help me give valuable results back to my reasearch is called AstroResult. This will be private forever but uses libraries from SciPy, Matplotlib, astroML and NumPy. AstroResult takes information from places that give it the most accurate information and the most data to project an accurate reading of the information it needs to project to the creator of the system. AstroResult is my main project that I constantly talk about and improve because I wish to be an astrophysicist and this is good reasearch for me.

To end of my project list is a simple UI made by the language of python. This UI (which doesn't have a name as of right now) allows you to have a conversation by typing out answers or responses to questions and statements given by this UI. The UI has a wide list of responses allowing one to talk to the UI and can be expected different responses each time since this UI has a list of all the words in the English language and utlizes this and creates a list of repsonses. The UI gives good advice and emotional strength when one feels down but by laptop! It won't seem real but might work (as much as it didn't work on me all that well really).


I am currently focusing on creating more functional bots using the discord.js library and I am still working on more codespaces using astroML and SciPy to further deepen my understanding to the universe. My quenching thirst for knowledge drives me!

The main languages I use are:
- Python
- Java Script
- CSS
- Type Script
- C/C+
- OCaml
