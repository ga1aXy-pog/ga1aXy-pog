Hello, my name is ga1aXy-pog on github, but I go as galaxy (my online alias). A few things to know about me is that I spend most of my time learning and discovering new things in a broad spectrum, 
I love music and podcasts, I enjoy watching TV shows like MacGyver, Magnum P.I.(+), Manifest, The Good Doctor, Friends, Seinfield and The Big Bang Theory. I also enjoy playing sport in my free time and creating a few stuff.

My learning spectrum holds subjects like physics, astrophysics, quantum physics (yeah I love physics), mathematics, biology and technology. My code is primarly focused on things that I need help visualizing on the things that I am learning about.
My code visualizing is focused on theories that I work on in physics (mainly to do with the "astro" side, as I am hoping to pursue a career in astrophysics). While most of my theory work will be closed to the public, you might see some of the projects that I have finished and have given good results back to me.

While I am used to expressing my view in politics, I don't identify as anything (just becuase I don't support all sides of the argument given by politicans).

Ah yes, bye.
